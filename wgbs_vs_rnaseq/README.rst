Scripts to compare methylation vs. expression
=============================================

Scripts in the subfolders can be ran in any order.

Brief description of subfolder contents
---------------------------------------
1. ``expr_vs_meth_status/`` checks whether genic methylation affects expression. Creates Fig. 4c.

2. ``functional_enrichment/`` compares methylation state vs. differentially expressed genes (distinguishing between methylated/unmethylated vs. over-/underexpressed). Produces Figs. 4e, 4f.

3. ``spurious_transcription/`` checks whether methylated and unmethylated genes have differing amounts of spurious transcription. Makes Fig. 4g.

4. ``transcription_noise/`` also checks whether transcription noise is lower in methylated genes. Makes Fig. 4h.

Bismark report for: /home/liewy/data_repo/symb/02_3temp_3rep_meth/26-Alpha_S1_L001_R2_001.trim.fastq (version: v0.13.0)
Option '--non_directional' specified: alignments to all strands were being performed (OT, OB, CTOT, CTOB)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /home/liewy/kaust/styl/dna_meth/raw_data/bis_genomes/salmo_genome/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.6 --ignore-quals

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequences analysed in total:	1179652
Number of alignments with a unique best hit from the different alignments:	12500
Mapping efficiency:	1.1%
Sequences with no alignments under any condition:	1167146
Sequences did not map uniquely:	6
Sequences which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	28

Number of sequences with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/CT:	5753	((converted) top strand)
CT/GA:	6567	((converted) bottom strand)
GA/CT:	73	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/GA:	79	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)

Bismark report for: /home/liewy/data_repo/symb/02_3temp_3rep_meth/26-Alpha_S1_L001_R1_001.trim.fastq and /home/liewy/data_repo/symb/02_3temp_3rep_meth/26-Alpha_S1_L001_R2_001.trim.fastq (version: v0.13.0)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /home/liewy/kaust/styl/dna_meth/raw_data/bis_genomes/smic_genome_masked/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.6 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --maxins 500
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	1179652
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	211068
Mapping efficiency:	17.9% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	934187
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	34397
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	13

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	105737	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	105318	((converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0

Scripts to analyse gene expression
==================================

Scripts in these subfolders can be executed in any order.

Brief description of subfolder contents
---------------------------------------
1. ``pca_and_heatmap/`` plots the PCA and correlation plots for 9 *S. microadriaticum* cultures (n = 3 for 26C, 29C and 32C). These scripts produce Fig. 4a and Fig. 4b.

2. ``overlap_rep_elements/`` checks whether RNA-seq reads maps to genomic regions annotated as "repeat elements". Does repeat expression increase with temperature? Script produces Fig. 2c.
